# Fylo-Landing-Page - software security website clone, design found on frontendmentor.io

Live Site: https://jonkohjj.github.io/Fylo-Landing-Page/

I used pure HTML and CSS to create this landing page / website and as always, I implemented responsive layouts to be used on mobile, tablet or desktop view. The design was taken from frontendmentor.io (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd) and then built from scratch.

Concepts learnt -
1. Negative margins
2. media queries (more in depth - ideal screen sizes and their respective px/em value, multiple conditions)
3. Writing maintainable and clean code (reduce the number of duplicated lines)

Next challenge - to use SASS in the next project
